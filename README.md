# DayZ n Chill's Thermal Scopes
Thermal Scopes for DayZ 1.13+

# About The Mod!
Ok. So a little background. This mod was originally created by Dylan for our DZNC and BLACKOUT Servers. We paid an excessive amount of money, several hundred dollars, to Dylan to keep this mod private and exclusive. We even got him to sign a contract. That didn't seem to matter to Dylan as we all know what happened next. This mod was found being sold for 40$ a pop on Dylans discord. And now that he has been shut down from the DayZ community I plan on updating and maintaing the mod myself, as well as a few other I purchased the source for from him. So long story short. I am releasing it to the public free of charge.

# Fixes I have made so far
I have drastically improved the visuals of the thermals, as well as removed any unnecessary code.

# Bug
There are bugs. It is not perfect by any means. Please report them in the discussion tab.

# Instructions:
With these files you will need to pack each folder seperately and place them in your mod pack.

# Future Plans
More Scopes, along with scope types. White Hot, Red Hot, etc...
Animals are coming Next

# Can I Repack?
That is why the source files are here in the wild for you to use.
